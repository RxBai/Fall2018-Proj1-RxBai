### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

**Running the .rmd file in this folder requires package 'Rccp' 0.12.13.**

**If running the code for the first time takes more than 5 minutes, please try again, it will probably be faster and less than 5 minutes. I am not sure why this happens, but the running this file takes about 3 to 4 minutes on my computer.**
